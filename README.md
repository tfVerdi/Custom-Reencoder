# Verdi's custom video reencoder

A tool for reencoding videos using FFmpeg and HandBrakeCLI, designed specifically to use in conjunction with Méliès and SparklyFX.

There are two versions available, use footage_encoder.py to process videos in bulk, single_footage_reencoder.py for singular videos.

You also need to fill the data.json file with your system's paths so the program knows where to look for stuff and where to leave the processed stuff.
